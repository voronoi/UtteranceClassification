To run the problem set 3 program, place the python file in a directory with the
following subdirectories present:

"data" with the provided training data .csv files
"testdata" with the held-out .csv files

Then, navigate to the directory that contains the python file and run it. A
subdirectory called "result" will be created that contains a .csv file in the
same format as the input that contains the test data lines with the
question/answer and emotional/material columns replaced with the program's
classifications.
